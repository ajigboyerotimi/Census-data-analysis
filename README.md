This project examines the census data of a town to gain insight into key demographic factors.  The insight gained is then used to inform the decision-making process on what to build on an unoccupied expanse of land and where to invest Government funds. Included in this repository is a jupyter notebook showing the cleaning and analysis done in a python environment. A copy of the census data (census02.csv) used is included as well as a pdf of the project report.
